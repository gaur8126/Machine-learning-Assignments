    "The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model, such as logistic regression. It plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. Here's a detailed explanation of the ROC curve and its use in evaluating the performance of a logistic regression model:\n",

    "For example, if false positives are particularly costly, one might choose a threshold that minimizes the FPR while maintaining an acceptable TPR.\n",
    "Model Comparison: The ROC curve allows for the comparison of multiple models. A model with a higher AUC is generally considered better.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the ROC curves of different models, one can assess which model performs best across various thresholds.\n",
    "Performance Metrics: The ROC curve provides a more comprehensive view of model performance than metrics like accuracy, which can be misleading, especially with imbalanced datasets."

    "Enhances Interpretability: A model with fewer features is easier to understand and interpret, which is especially important in domains where explainability is crucial.\n",

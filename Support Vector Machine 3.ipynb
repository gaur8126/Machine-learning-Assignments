    "### Best Metric for House Price Prediction\n",
    "For predicting house prices, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is often considered the best metric because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It provides an error measure in the same units as the predicted variable (house prices), making it easy to interpret.\n",
    "* It penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones, which is important in house price prediction where large errors can be particularly costly.\n",
    "* It balances the benefits of MSE (penalizing large errors) and MAE (interpretability).\n",
    "* Therefore, RMSE would be the most suitable regression metric to employ in this situation for evaluating the performance of your SVM regression model.\n"

    "### Common Time series patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trend: A long-term increase or decrease in the data. It can be identified by plotting the data and observing the overall direction. For example, an upward trend in sales over several years.\n",
    "2. Seasonality: Regular, repeating patterns or cycles in data, usually over a fixed period such as a year, month, or week. Seasonal patterns can be identified using seasonal decomposition techniques.\n",
    "3. Cyclical Patterns: Fluctuations that are not of a fixed period but are influenced by economic or business cycles. These can be harder to identify as they do not follow a fixed, predictable pattern.\n",
    "4. Irregular/Noise: Random variations or 'noise' that do not follow any pattern. This can be identified after removing trend and seasonal components from the data."

    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumes Historical Patterns Continue: Time series analysis assumes that past patterns will continue in the future, which may not hold in changing conditions.\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers: Time series models can be highly sensitive to outliers, affecting accuracy.\n",
    "Stationarity Requirement: Many models require the time series to be stationary, which may not be the case in real-world data.\n",
    "Complex Interactions: May not capture complex interactions between multiple time series effectively.\n",
    "Example Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a pandemic, traditional time series models may struggle as the historical data before the pandemic may not reflect the new patterns and shifts in consumer behavior during and after the pandemic. This abrupt change challenges the assumption that historical patterns will continue, making forecasts less reliable."

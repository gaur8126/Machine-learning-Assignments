    "Bayes' theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. It relates the conditional probability of a hypothesis given evidence to the conditional probability of the evidence given the hypothesis and the prior probability of the hypothesis."

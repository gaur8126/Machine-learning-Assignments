    "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that aims to improve the predictive performance of a model by combining several weak learners to form a strong learner. A weak learner is a model that performs slightly better than random guessing. Boosting works by sequentially training weak learners, each one trying to correct the errors of its predecessor. The final model is a weighted sum of these weak learners"

    "### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Accuracy: Boosting often leads to significant improvements in predictive accuracy compared to individual weak learners.\n",
    "Reduced Overfitting: Boosting methods, such as AdaBoost, can reduce the risk of overfitting, especially when used with simple models.\n",
    "Versatility: Boosting can be applied to various types of models, including decision trees, linear models, and more.\n",
    "Robustness to Outliers: Some boosting algorithms can be robust to outliers in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally Intensive: Boosting can be computationally expensive and time-consuming due to its iterative nature.\n",
    "Sensitivity to Noisy Data: Boosting algorithms can be sensitive to noisy data, as they attempt to correct all errors, including those caused by noise.\n",
    "Overfitting with Too Many Weak Learners: If not properly regularized, boosting can overfit the training data, especially when using too many weak learners."
